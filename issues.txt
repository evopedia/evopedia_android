- search bar with popup in ActionBar (closed in beta2)
- sometimes, search results are not selectable (solved in beta2)
- select archives to search in
- option to select wikipedia mobile stylesheet
- separate thread for title search (closed in beta2)
- correct usage of back stack
  - using singleTop in the manifest file, storing own stack of urls and
    intercepting the back button
  - this way, we do not start a TitleAdapter thread in each activity
    and retain the search "dialog" properties for each activity
